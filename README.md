**Main Features:**

- **User Registration:** Users can create accounts as `Citizen`, `Guest`, or `Administrator`, with each role providing access to specific system features. Additionally, the `Administrator` role includes multiple sub-roles, as defined by the organization head, allowing for more granular administrative privileges.

- **Dynamic Dashboard Rendering:** The dashboard displays components based on the user's access privileges received from the backend. Users see only the features and navigation options relevant to their role (`Citizen`, `Guest`, or `Administrator`).

- **Role-Based Access:** After login, the frontend uses the access privileges provided by the server to generate the exact set of components and actions each user is allowed. For example, only `Administrator` users need to enter a Secret Code (provided by the organization) during registration to create an account.

- **Secret Code for Administrators:** Only users registering as Administrators are required to enter a secret code provided by the organization. This code verifies their role and determines their level of system access.

- **Birth Registration:** Easily register births online without visiting government offices. Submit all required information digitally through intuitive forms.

- **Certificate Verification:** Quickly verify the authenticity of birth certificates using our secure verification system. Users can enter a certificate number or scan a QR code to check validity.

- **Digital Certificates:** Download and print official birth certificates with secure QR codes for verification from anywhere areound the world.

- **Responsive Design:** The UI is optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices, ensuring a seamless experience everywhere.
